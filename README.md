OMB Agency/Bureau and Treasury Codes
===========

This repository contains an index of OMB (Office of Management and Budget) agency and bureau codes for organizations in the United States Federal Government. These files list these codes in budget order, with the corresponding 2-digit Treasury agency and the 30-digit Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC) agency does assigned by the Treasury.

What Problem This Solves
------------------------

Historically, this data has only been available via PDF (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a11_current_year/app_c.pdf). Having the data in CSV format allows easier analysis and automation by developers and agencies wishing to use government data, in line with the goals of [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/).

How This Solves It
------------------

A lot of time spent in Excel and Vim, plus some handy regex. Oh, and copy & paste. If you notice anything wrong, please open a ticket (or even better, a pull request).
